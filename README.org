* Dependency Installation
The aquarium uses Raylib. Compile and install it (as a static library).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt install build-essential git libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libgflw3-dev
  git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git raylib
  cd raylib/src
  make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP GRAPHICS=GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL_33 -j$(nproc)
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

* Compilation of Aquarium
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # from the root of the project
  pwd # should be something like /path/to/fishy-merry-go-round/
  make -j$(nproc)
#+END_SRC

* Running
Run the aquarium software suite with: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # from the root of the project
  MESH_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3 ./main.out
  python scanner.py --cam 2 --path resoures/textures/ # running the scanner application
#+END_SRC

Scanner Usage:
Use the "s" key to take and save the image, "q" to quit running. Make sure the fish is entirely visible.

* Working
Essentially, the scanner and aquarium communicate through a file watcher setup. The scanner saves processed fish textures into resources/, and the aquarium loads and renders any newly added ones.
